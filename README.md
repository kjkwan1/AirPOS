## 4. Architecture

### Client-Side
- **Framework:** Angular
  - Angular will serve as the front-end framework, offering a scalable and maintainable single-page application (SPA).
- **Mobile Integration:** Capacitor
  - Use Capacitor to wrap the Angular application into a cross-platform mobile app.
  - Leverage native device features such as camera access for QR code scanning, local storage for offline functionality, and push notifications.

### Authentication
- **Firebase Authentication:**
  - Utilize Firebase Auth for secure and scalable user authentication.
  - Support multiple authentication methods including email/password and multi-factor authentication.

### Data Storage and Synchronization
- **Local Storage (Offline):**
  - Use an embedded database (e.g., SQLite via Capacitor) for local data storage, ensuring functionality during offline periods.
- **Cloud Storage:**
  - **Cloud Relational Database:**
    - Employ a cloud-hosted relational database (e.g., Google Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS) using PostgreSQL/MySQL.
    - Centralize company data, transaction logs, inventory, and reporting information.
  - **Data Synchronization:**
    - Implement a synchronization service that periodically or in real time syncs local data with the cloud database.
    - Develop conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure data consistency.

### Backend Services & API Layer
- **API Layer:**
  - Build RESTful APIs (or consider GraphQL) hosted in the cloud to manage CRUD operations for company, site, user, transaction, and inventory data.
  - Ensure the API handles authentication (using Firebase tokens), data validation, and business logic.
- **Serverless Functions:**
  - Consider using serverless options (e.g., Firebase Cloud Functions or AWS Lambda) for lightweight operations like receipt delivery, notifications, and data processing.

### Security & Compliance
- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **Compliance:**
  - Follow industry standards such as PCI-DSS for payment information and GDPR for user data.
- **Access Controls:**
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) both on the client and API sides.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Payment Gateways:**
  - Integrate with payment gateways to facilitate QR code payments and payment link processing.
- **Analytics:**
  - Integrate with analytics services to provide real-time dashboards and performance reports.
